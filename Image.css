Sure—here’s a ready-to-use SVG file content you can copy into a .svg file and then export to PNG at your desired size. It follows the five-section layout described, with blue left cards and right-side flow details.

Copy this into a file named cleaner-city-flow.svg and open in Inkscape/Illustrator/Figma, then export as PNG.

Notes:
You can adjust the width/height by editing the SVG’s viewBox and the outer SVG attributes.
Replace emoji with proper icons if you prefer vector icons (in Inkscape/Illustrator you can swap text icons with inline SVG icons).
If you want a PNG export at a specific resolution, open the SVG in your editor and export PNG at 1080x1350, 1920x1080, etc.

Would you like me to tailor the SVG with your exact brand colors and typography, or generate a PNG directly from this SVG at a chosen resolution? If you share width, height, and hex color codes, I’ll customize and provide an updated SVG.
